# Overview

This project is a **"Guess the Number" game** written in Java. The purpose of this software is to enhance my skills as a software engineer by building an interactive and enjoyable application. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a certain number of attempts, depending on the chosen difficulty level.

Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of Java syntax, object-oriented programming principles, file handling, and user interaction through the console. This was a great opportunity to explore abstract classes, inheritance, and the importance of structuring code for maintainability.

# Development Environment

- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries/Tools:**
    - Java Standard Library (for I/O operations and random number generation)
